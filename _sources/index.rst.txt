Welcome to Namazu's documentation!
========================================

**Namazu** (from the earthquake-causing giant catfish in Japanese mythology) is a framework for vibration experiments using shaking tables. **Namazu** is *independent* of operating systems, programming languages and frameworks, as long as the software can interface with serial ports. We provide here documentation for choice of hardware (motors, drivers etc.), the microcontroller firmware and the current implementation in MATLAB and Python.

The motivation behind this framework is to offer a versatile and low-cost framework for research and education for dynamic systems and earthquake engineering. Through our background in these fields we designed the firmware with earthquake signal generation from stochastic processes in mind.
