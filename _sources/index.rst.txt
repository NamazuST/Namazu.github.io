Welcome to Namazu's documentation!
========================================

**Namazu** (openShakingTable) is a framework for vibration experiments using shaking tables. **Namazu** is *independent* of operating systems, programming languages and frameworks, as long as the software can interface with serial ports. We provide here documentation for choice of hardware (motors, drivers etc.), the microcontroller firmware and the current implementation in MATLAB and Python.
